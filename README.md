# The Nostr Tip Jar
![tip jar](https://github.com/Marc26z/NostrTipJars/blob/main/assets/TipJarHTML.png?raw=true)

Now that bitcoin payments are possible at many brick and mortar businesses, I decided to create the Nostr Tip Jar. This is an idea I have tinkered with since 2019, but it was too early to implement back then. Nostr fixes this. If you are an employee that works at a business that accepts tips, say Steak N Shake or one of the many merchants that accept bitxoin on the Square Terminals, why not try to earn some bitcoin tips? 

It's easy. All you need to do is download the Primal App. You can import your own lightning address, or sign up with the lightning address on [Primal](https://primal.net/downloads).(Phone number required). If you need help, [watch this tutorial by BTCSessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd4Po4i7wvc).


## How To Make Your Own 
Sign up for the Primal App. You can use the lightning addres they provide or import another one. **Remember these wallets are meant for tips, not your life's savings.** You should use more secure, federated, or on chain wallets to secure meaninful amounts of bitcoin**.  Treat this like spending cash in your wallet, not cash in your bank account or savings instrument. You might want to save most of your tips, but that's a different tutorial.
1. Touch the QR code icon on your Primal app profile.

2. The default QR code is your nostr public key, but we want to click on the lightning address tab.
3. ![npub](https://github.com/Marc26z/NostrTipJars/blob/main/assets/NpubQR.png?raw=true)
4. Take a screenshot of the lightning address according to your phone's specifications. Print this QR code onto card stock, high enough on the paper to cut the paper so it fits into the jar like this. We essentially made a bookmark out of our lightnign address:
 ![LN Bookmark](https://github.com/Marc26z/NostrTipJars/blob/main/assets/Bookmark.jpg?raw=true)
I wrote the word Tips on it and created a border with an alcohol marker, but this is not required.
5. Insert the bookmark into a plastic jar. I first tried it with glass, but I decided plastic is safer.

6. Decorate the Jar.  I used a sharpie and water color pencils, but you can use whatever you have. You are limited ony by your imagination.

7. (Optinal) Print some e-cash from [Gandalf's Money Printer Go Brrrrrr website](https://brrr.gandlaf.com/). These are are meant to give people small amounts of [Cashu](https://cashu.space/), but we are using them for decoration. I folded them on to the jar because I like the way it looks like people are stuffing bitcoin into the jar. If you need to mint some cashu to print the paper, try minibits wallet, but only use very small amounts as this is experimental technology. Please read the warnings at the [Minibits.cash Github repository](https://github.com/minibits-cash/minibits_wallet).

### Other Resourses:
- You can also add another lightning address. There are too many options to name, but here is a [decent list](https://lightningaddress.com/#providers). 
- Here is a [cute lightning accepted here cartoon](https://github.com/Marc26z/NostrTipJars/blob/main/assets/btclightning-300x110-1-1.png) I borowed from Cryptocloaks.com with permission. 
- I also added [the bitcoin logo here](https://github.com/Marc26z/NostrTipJars/blob/main/assets/Bitcoin.svg.png?raw=true).
